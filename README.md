### Biography ðŸš€
&emsp;&emsp;Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is **Kecai Xuan** and you can call me Ayin. I am an undergraduate student in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn) majoring **Chemical Physics** and I love physics, especially *Theoretical Mechanics* and *Statistical Mechanics*. Currently I am back from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) where I served as an undergraduate research intern focusing on *Raman Spectra calculation from first principles*. Besides, AI for Science is always on my reading list and I'm trying hard to learn **TensorFlow/Pytorch** to do some interesting data analyses.

&emsp;&emsp;In USTC, my graduate project is about NMR data excavation, especially on the *Intrincically Disordered Proteins*. We are curious about the force field coefficients and are trying to tackle this problem with the help of Machine Learning methods.
