### Biography ðŸš€
&emsp;&emsp;I graduated from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn) majoring **Chemical Physics** and I love physics, especially *Theoretical Mechanics* and *Statistical Mechanics*. Durning the summer and autumn of 2023, I was a research intern in [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) focusing on *Raman Spectra calculation from first principles*. Besides, AI for Science is always on my reading list and I have a good understanding on **TensorFlow** to solve some Machine Learning & Deep Learning problems.

&emsp;&emsp;In USTC, my graduate project was about NMR data excavation, especially on the *Intrincically Disordered Proteins*. We were curious about the force field coefficients and successfully predicted the parameters from NMR spectrum with the help of Transformer and LSTM model.

&emsp;&emsp;I have decided to attend [University of Maryland-College Park](https://umd.edu) to pursue my PhD degree in chemistry.
